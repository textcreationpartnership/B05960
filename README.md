1. An Expoſition UPON THE PREFACE OF SrGEORGE RIPLEY, Canon of Bridlington.

    _ In the Beginning, when thou madest all of nought, a globous matter, and dark, under confuſion, by him the beginning,
&c.

    _ For as of one Maſs was made all things, right ſo in our practice muſt it be.

    _ All our Secrets of one Image muſt ſpring.

    _ As in Philoſophers Books, whoſo liſt to ſee.

    _ Our Stone is called the Leſſer World.

    _ One and Three.

    _ Magneſia alſo.

    _ Of Sulphur and Mercury.

    _ Proportionate by Nature moſt perfectly.

    _ But many one marvelleth, and marvel may, and muſeth on ſuch a marvellous thing.

    _ What is our Stone, &c.

    _ For Fowls and Fiſhes to us do it bring, every Man it hath: And it is in every place, in thee, in me, &c.

    _ To this I anſwer, That Mercury it is I wis.

    _ But not the Common, called Quick-ſilver by name.

    _ But Mercury, without which nothing being is.

    _ All Philoſophers record and truly ſain the ſame.

    _ But ſimple Searchers putteth them in blame, ſaying they hid it.

    _ But they be blame-worthy which be no Clerks, and meddle with Philoſophy.

    _ But though it Mercury be.

    _ Yet wiſely underſtand wherein it is, and where thou ſhalt it ſeek.

    _ Elſe I counſel thee take not this work in hand.

    _ For Philoſophers flatter Fools with fair ſpeech.

    _ But liſten to me, for truly I will thee teach.

    _ Which is this Mercury most profitable.

    _ Being to thee nothing deceiveable.

    _ It is more near in ſome things than in ſome.

    _ Take heed therefore what I to thee write.

    _ For if to thee Knowledge never come,Therefore yet ſhalt thou me not twite.

    _ For I will truely now thee excite to underſtand well Mercuries three.

    _ The Keys which of this Science be.

    _ Reymund his Menſtrues doth them call.

    _ Without them truly no Truth is done.

    _ But two of them be ſuperficial.

    _ The third Eſſential to Sun and Moon.

    _ Their Properties I will declare right ſoon.

    _ And Mercury of Metals eſsential,Is the Principle of our Stone material.

    _ In Sol and Luna our Menstrues are not ſeen.

    _ It appeareth not but by effect to ſight.

    _ This is the Stone of which we mean,Who ſo our Writings conceiveth aright.

    _ It is a Soul and Subſtance bright.

    _ Of Sol and Luna a ſubtile Influence.

    _ Whereby the Earth receiveth reſplendence.

    _ For what is Sol and Luna, ſaith Avicen,But Earth which is pure White & Red?

    _ Take from it the ſaid Clearneſs, and thenThat Earth will ſtand but in little ſtead.

    _ The whole Compound is called our Lead.

    _ The quality of Clearneſs from Sol and Luna doth come.

    _ Theſe are our Menſtrues, both all and ſome.

    _ Bodies with the firſt we Calcine naturally, perfect.

    _ But none which been unclean.

    _ Except one.

    _ Which is uſuallyNamed by Philoſophers their Lyon Green.

    _ He is the mean the Sun and Moon between,Of joyning Tinctures with perfectneſs.

    _ As Geber thereunto beareth witneſs.

    _ With the ſecond which is an humidityVegetable reviving what earſt was dead.

    _ Both Principles Materials must looſed be.

    _ And Formals, elſe they ſtand in little ſtead.

    _ Theſe Menſtrues therefore know, I thee reed.

    _ Without the which neither true CalcinationDone may be, nor true Diſſolution.

    _ With the third Humidity moſt permanent.

    _ Incombustible and unctuous in his Nature.

    _ Hermes Tree unto Aſhes is burnt.

    _ It is our natural Fire moſt ſure.

    _ Our Mercury, our Sulphur, our Tincture pure.

    _ Our Soul, our Stone born up with wind,In the Earth ingendred. Bear this in mind.

    _ This Stone alſo tell thee I dare,Is the vapour of Metals potential.

    _ How thou ſhalt get it thou muſt beware,For Inviſible truly is this Menſtrual.Howbeit with the ſecond Water Philoſophical,By ſeparation of Elements it may appearTo ſight in form of Water clear.

    _ Of this Menſtrue by labour exuberate,With it may be made Sulphur of Nature.

    _ If it be well and kindly acuate,And circulate into a Spirit pure,Then to diſſolve thou must be ſureThy baſe with it in divers wiſe,As thou ſhalt know by thy practiſe,That point, &c.

    _ For ſo together they may be circulate,That is, the baſe oyl and vegetable Menſtrual,So that it be by labour exuberate,And made by craft a Stone celeſtial.

    _ Of nature ſo Fiery that we it call,Our Baſilisk, or our Cockatrice,Our great Elixir moſt of price.For as the ſight of the Baſilisk his objectKilleth, ſo ſlayeth it crude Mercury,When thereupon he is project,In twinkling of an eye moſt ſuddenly.That Mercury then teyneth permanentlyAll Metals to Gold and Silver perfite.Thus guide thy baſe both red and white.

    _ Aurum Potabile thus is made,Of Gold not commonly calcinate.

    _ But of our Tincture which will not fade,Out of our baſe drawn by our Menstrue circulate.

    _ And for thy first ground principal,Ʋnderſtand thy Waters Menstrual.

    _ And when thou haſt made Calcination,Increaſing not wasting moiſture radical,Ʋntil thy baſe by oft ſubtilation,Will lightly flow as Wax on a Metal.Then looſe it with thy Vegetable Menſtrual,Till thou have Oyl thereof in colour bright.

    _ Then is that Menstruum viſible to ſight.

    _ An Oyl is drawn out in the colour of Gold.

    _ Or like thereto out of fine red Lead.

    _ Which Raymund ſaid when he was old,Much more then Gold would ſtand in ſtead.

    _ For when he was for Age near dead,He made thereof Aurum Potabile,Which him revived as men might ſee.
